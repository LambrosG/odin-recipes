    <h2>How To Make Cherry Pie</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the award-winning cherry pie recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h4>Cherry Pie Ingredients</h4>
    <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade cherry pie recipe: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the crust: </strong>All-purpose flour, salt, shortening, and cold water</li>
        <li><strong>For the filling: </strong>Pitted sour cherries, white sugar, cornstarch, butter, and almond extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How To Make Cherry Pie Filling</h4>
    <p>You’ll learn how to make homemade cherry pie filling in the detailed, step-by-step recipe below – but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a pan. Let sit until the juices begin to release. </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until the juices are thickened. </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, then stir in the butter and almond extract. Let cool. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How Long To Bake Cherry Pie</h4>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), the cherry pie should be perfectly baked in 45-55 minutes. You’ll know the pie is done when the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. </p>
    <h2>How To Serve Cherry Pie</h2>
    <p>This cherry pie is perfect as-is. However, a dollop of homemade whipped cream or vanilla ice cream will take each slice over the top. Make sure to let the pie cool before serving to prevent runniness.</p>
    <h2>Does Cherry Pie Need to Be Refrigerated?</h2>
    <p>Since cherry pie filling doesn’t contain eggs or dairy, it can stay on the counter for up to two days. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to five days. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup shortening, chilled</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 cups pitted sour cherries</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>10 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in cold water by hand just until dough holds together. Divide dough in half and form into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Roll out 1 dough disk into an 11-inch circle and press it into a 9-inch pie dish. Place in the refrigerator until needed. Roll out remaining dough disk into an 11-inch circle for the top crust, transfer it to a plate or baking sheet, and refrigerate until needed.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking tray in the oven to preheat.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Place cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a medium, non-aluminum saucepan. Allow mixture to stand until juices begin to release, about 10 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and simmer until juices thicken and become translucent, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in butter and almond extract. Allow filling to cool to lukewarm.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Pour cooled filling into prepared pie crust. Cover with top crust, trim and crimp the edges to seal, and cut vents for steam.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven on the preheated baking tray until crust is golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool for several hours before slicing.</p>
